travellers had an idea. “The people here have a lot to learn,” he said.</p>
<p>“Let’s play a little trick on them and teach them a very big lesson!”</p>
<p>“An excellent idea,” said the second.</p>
<p>“But what sort of trick?” asked the third. “And what kind of lesson?”</p>
<p>“Gather round,” said the first. “And I’ll tell you.” And so, in whispers and
secret signs, he did. And as the plan unfolded, his two companions nodded
and grinned from ear to ear.</p>
<p>As soon as they were ready to put their plan into action, the first traveller spoke
in a big, booming voice so that the nearby townspeople were sure to hear.</p>
<p>“How terribly sad that the poor people in this town have no food,” he said.</p>
<p>“But never mind. We three shall go to the town-square and there, as night
falls, we shall make a pot of our DELICIOUS AND NUTRITIOUS STONE SOUP!”
When they heard this, the townspeople were extremely curious. They’d
never heard of stone soup and wondered how it was made and what it
tasted like.</p>
<p>“How do you make stone soup?” they asked the travellers.</p>
<p>“We’ll gladly show you,” replied the first.</p>
<p>“Follow us,” said the second.
