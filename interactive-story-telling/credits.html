    <p>Story by <a href="http://www.talkingtales.org/">Kevin Graal</a> © 2008</p>
    <p>Stone Soup is a traditional folktale found in many parts of the world. This web version of Stone Soup was created by <a href="http://laradominguez.com">Lara Dominguez</a>. All content for this web version, including images and words were taken directly from a <a href="http://documents.wfp.org/stellent/groups/public/documents/webcontent/wfp202398.pdf">storybook</a>, commissioned and distributed by <a href="https://www.unilever.com/">Unilever</a> to mark World Food Day, and to celebrate its partnership with the United Nations’ <a href="http://www.wfp.org/">World Food Programme</a>.</p>

    <p>The pictures here and in the World Food Programme's <a href="http://documents.wfp.org/stellent/groups/public/documents/webcontent/wfp202398.pdf">storybook</a> were created by children at the <a href="http://www.blackfriars-settlement.org.uk/">Blackfriars Settlement</a> Summer Play Scheme in London during August 2008, working with storyteller Kevin Graal, and artists Bryan Holdsworth and Lucy Brennan-Shiel of artzero children’s art. Design by Bryan Holdsworth. Unilever supports the Blackfriars Settlement in its work with local people to
       help them achieve their economic, educational and social potential.</p>
