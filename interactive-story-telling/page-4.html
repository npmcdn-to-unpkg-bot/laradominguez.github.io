    <p><span style="font-size:50px;">"A</span>nd bring a big empty pot with you and some firewood too,” said the third.
<p>So they did.</p>
<p>Arriving in the town-square, one of the travellers made a fire, another
filled the empty pot with water and the third placed it over the fire to boil.</p>
<p>“And now,” said the first, “for the special ingredients.” With a grand and
dramatic flourish so that everyone could see, he reached into a leather
satchel, took out three smooth round stones and plopped them into the pot
of water. “Soon we shall feast!” he exclaimed, stirring the pot with a big
wooden spoon.</p>
<p>As the rumour of a feast spread round the town, an excited crowd began
to gather in the square. “Just as we planned!” whispered the first traveller to
his friends.</p>
<p>After the pot of water had been boiling for some time, the travellers
began to sniff the air and lick their lips. “And now,” said the first, “I will taste
it!“ As the traveller lifted a spoonful of bubbling water to his mouth, the
crowd craned forward to hear his verdict. “It is completely ... delicious!”
he announced.</p>
<p>At this, the crowd gasped and gurgled with delight.</p>
<p>“True,” continued the traveller, “some people might say that it needs a little
salt and pepper, but apart from that it is practically perfect.”
