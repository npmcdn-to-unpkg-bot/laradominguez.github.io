    <p><span style="font-size:50px;">E</span>arly in the morning, just as the sun was rising, the travellers departed.</p>
<p>“Thank you so much for teaching us how to make stone soup,” said
the townspeople.</p>
<p>“You’re very welcome,” replied the travellers, nodding and grinning.</p>
<p>“Be sure to visit us again,” said the townspeople.</p>
<p>“We certainly will,” said the travellers.</p>
<p>And they did. And they all lived happily ever after.</p>
<p>Nobody knows for sure whether the townspeople ever realised that they’d
been tricked that night. But in a way, it doesn’t really matter because they
certainly DID learn a very important lesson: that when we each give a little,
we can achieve a lot!</p>
