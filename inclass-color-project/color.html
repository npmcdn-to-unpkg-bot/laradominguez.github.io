	<h2>Additive</h2>
	<p>Additive color is color created by mixing a number of different light colors, with Red, green, and blue being the primary colors normally used in additive color system.</p>
	<h2>Subtractive</h2>
	<p>A subtractive color model explains the mixing of a limited set of dyes, inks, paint pigments or natural colorants to create a wider range of colors, each the result of partially or completely subtracting (that is, absorbing) some wavelengths of light and not others.</p>

	<h2>Theory of Color</h2>
	<p>Color theory is a body of practical guidance to color mixing and the visual effects of a specific color combination. </p>
	<h3>Primary</h3>
    <p>Primary colors are sets of colors that can be combined to make a useful range of colors.</p>
	<h3>Secondary</h3>
    <p>A secondary color is a color made by mixing two primary colors in a given color space.</p>
	<h3>Tertiary</h3>
    <p>A tertiary color or quaternary color is a made by mixing either one color with one, or two secondary colors.</p>

	<h2>Color Models</h2>
	<p>A color model is an abstract mathematical model describing the way colors can be represented as tuples of numbers, typically as three or four values or color components. When this model is associated with a precise description of how the components are to be interpreted (viewing conditions, etc.), the resulting set of colors is called color space.</p>
	<h3>Analogous</h3>
	<p>Analogous colors are groups of three colors that are next to each other on the color wheel, with one being the dominant color, which tends to be a primary or secondary color, and a tertiary. Red, orange, and red-violet are examples.</p>
	<h3>Monochromatic</h3>
	<p>Describes paintings, drawings, design, or photographs in one color or values of one color.[2] A monochromatic object or image reflects colors in shades of limited colors or hues. Images using only shades of grey (with or without black and/or white) are called grayscale or black-and-white. </p>
	<h3>Triadic</h3>
	<p>A triadic color scheme uses colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel. Triadic color harmonies tend to be quite vibrant, even if you use pale or unsaturated versions of your hues. To use a triadic harmony successfully, the colors should be carefully balanced - let one color dominate and use the two others for accent.</p>
	<h3>Complementary</h3>
	<p>Colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel are considered to be complementary colors (example: red and green). The high contrast of complementary colors creates a vibrant look especially when used at full saturation. This color scheme must be managed well so it is not jarring. Complementary colors are tricky to use in large doses, but work well when you want something to stand out. Complementary colors are really bad for text. </p>

	<h2>Examples of Color Psychology and Symbolism</h2>
	<h3>Red</h3>
    <p>Red is the color of extremes. It’s the color of passionate love, seduction, violence, danger, anger, and adventure. Our prehistoric ancestors saw red as the color of fire and blood – energy and primal life forces – and most of red’s symbolism today arises from its powerful associations in the past.</p>
	<h3>Orange</h3>
    <p>Orange symbolizes energy, vitality, cheer, excitement, adventure, warmth, and good health. However, pure orange can be brass; however, it may suggest a lack of serious intellectual values and bad taste.</p>
	<h3>Yellow</h3>
    <p>It’s the color of happiness, and optimism, of enlightenment and creativity, sunshine and spring. Lurking in the background is the dark side of yellow: cowardice, betrayal, egoism, and madness. Furthermore, yellow is the color of caution and physical illness (jaundice, malaria, and pestilence). Perhaps it’s no coincidence that the sources of yellow pigments are toxic metals - cadmium, lead, and chrome - and urine.</p>
	<h3>Green</h3>
    <p>Green is universally associated with nature. Green symbolizes ecology and the environment. Traffic lights are green all over the world.</p>
	<h3>Blue</h3>
    <p>Most blues convey a sense of trust, loyalty, cleanliness, and understanding. On the other hand, blue evolved as symbol of depression in American culture. “Singing the blues” and feeling blue” are good examples of the complexity of color symbolism and how it has been evolved in different cultures.</p>
	<h3>Violet/Purple</h3>
    <p>Purple’s rarity in nature and the expense of creating the color and has given purple a supernatural aura for centuries. Purple is also the most powerful wavelength of the rainbow – and it’s a color with a powerful history that has evolved over time. In fact, the origins of the symbolism of purple are more significant and interesting than those of any other color.</p>
	<h3>Black</h3>
    <p>The color black relates to the hidden, the secretive and the unknown, and as a result it creates an air of mystery. It keeps things bottled up inside, hidden from the world. In color psychology this color gives protection from external emotional stress. It creates a barrier between itself and the outside world, providing comfort while protecting its emotions and feelings, and hiding its vulnerabilities, insecurities and lack of self confidence. Black is the absorption of all color and the absence of light. Black hides, while white brings to light. What black covers, white uncovers.</p>
	<h3>White</h3>
    <p>White is color at its most complete and pure, the color of perfection. The color meaning of white is purity, innocence, wholeness and completion. In color psychology white is the color of new beginnings, wiping the slate clean, so to speak. It is the blank canvas waiting to be written upon. While white isn't stimulating to the senses, it opens the way for the creation of anything the mind can conceive.</p>
