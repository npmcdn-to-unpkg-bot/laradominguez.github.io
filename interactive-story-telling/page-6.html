    <p><span style="font-size:50px;">S</span>crumptious! Although ... I suppose that a few little fishes and possibly some potatoes and perhaps some oil or margarine would improve the flavour ever so slightly, but apart from that – and maybe some barley and some leeks and
some herbs and a drop or two of milk or cream – I can truly say that the king
himself would be happy to eat this most delicious and nutritious stone soup!”</p>
<p>When the crowd heard these words, they were deeply impressed and off
they ran to fetch all the food which they had hidden earlier that evening.</p>
<p>Soon they returned with sacks and barrows full of tasty ingredients, which the
travellers piled into the pot as quickly as they could. “Food fit for a king!”
murmured the townspeople. “And all made from stones! Isn’t it amazing?!”</p>
<p>Finally, the travellers announced that the soup was ready. “But don’t worry,”
said the first. “There’s enough for everybody!” Tables and chairs were
placed in the square and bowls and spoons and napkins too. Torches were
lit and decorations hung. In the middle of the hustle and bustle, a townsman
called out, “A soup as special as this deserves nothing but the best! Let’s
fetch bread and beer and barrels of wine!” And so the feast began and
everyone agreed that they’d never tasted anything so delicious in their lives.</p>
<p>And when the feast was over, the townspeople listened with rapt attention
as the travellers told their tales from far and wide. And the townspeople told
the travellers all about their lives in the town. And then there was singing and
    dancing until late into the night.</p>
