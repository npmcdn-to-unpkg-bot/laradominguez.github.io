    <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
    <p>My name is Lara Dominguez and I'm a designer, photographer, and music enthusiast residing in New York City. I work in the finance trade during the day and as an artist, I focus on graphic design, web development, and photography. I feel very lucky that I'm able to make art for myself and even luckier that people then want to experience it, engage with it, or understand it. I work on many self-projects, collaborations and experimentations as I believe these are important for the creative thought to expand and develop. It doesn't matter what you do, if you care enough it becomes art.</p>
