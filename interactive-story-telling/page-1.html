	<h2>Once upon a time. . . </h2>

	<p>just as the sun was setting, three weary travellers came to the edge of a town. Their feet were blistered. Their mouths were dry and their bellies were aching with hunger.
	<p>“I’m starving,” moaned the first.</p>
<p>“I’m exhausted,” groaned the second.</p>
<p>“Let’s stop in this town and ask for help,” said the third.</p>
<p>Now the people who lived in this town were by no means rich and what little food they had, they always kept for themselves – hiding it even from their friends and relations. When they looked out of their houses and saw the three travellers, they said to each other, “Look! Hungry strangers! We know what they want! Quick! Let’s hide all the food and pretend we have nothing!” And that’s exactly what they did.</p>
