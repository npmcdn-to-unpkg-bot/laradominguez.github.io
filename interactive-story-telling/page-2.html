<p>“Good day and peace be with you,” said the first. “Will you please kindly
share with us a little of your food?”</p>
<p>“And a corner where we can sleep for the night?” added the second.</p>
<p>“We’ll tell you all about our travels in return,” promised the third.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” said the man of the house. “We gave all our spare food to the
travellers who came here last week.”</p>
<p>“And there’s only one room in this house,” said the man’s wife.</p>
<p>Both of them were lying.</p>
<p>The travellers sighed and went to the next house.</p>
<p>“Go away!” said the owners. “The harvest was very bad this year and every
bit of food we had is gone!”</p>
<p>They too were lying.</p>
<p>At every house the answer was the same. The townspeople always found an
excuse: their children were sick; they had relatives staying; they were going
away; a plague of mice had eaten everything – one lie after another! The
travellers knew that they were being lied to, but what could they do?
